                It was an amazing experience from start to finish, I wasn’t the easiest of customers but your expertise and eye for detail is a massive credit to you and your business and you really know how to make a bride to be feel special.
                On our beautiful wedding day everyone was commenting on how amazing the dress was and it truly was. You made sue that I felt comfortable over my numerous fittings and it really did fit like a glove, I was dancing for hours which I never thought possible in a strapless dress and the lace detail you added round the bust line for me was the finishing touch.
                Thank you again Sunay, I hope I get to visit your shop again one day (not being the bride of course).
